					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about
							communication, performance and convenience. Gestalt principles are always current helping us
							achieve these goals; creating a pleasant experience for the users and a great success for
							the business. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The Common Region principle is particularly useful. It can help with information grouping
							and content organisation, but it can also achieve content separation or act as a focal
							point. It boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception.
							What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to
							the message your piece is sharing?”
							— Laura Busche, Brand Content Strategist at Autodesk </p>
