				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it
							using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to
							let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
						<p> <img src="assets/wireframe.pdf" alt="a wireframe of google.com">A wireframe of Google.com</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for
							the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.
						</p>
						<p> <img src="assets/improved_wireframe.pdf" alt="">I had to do something...</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this?
							Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
						<p> The website is purely used for seaching for general users for all purposes. The design is simple but affective by
							leaving lots of negative space and emphasizing the searching function. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
						<p> There's really not much to do as it's a very mature and well designed website. But if I had to, I would say adding a
							contrasting color to the search bar could help a bit focusing. </p>
					</li>
					<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just
						put it in your assets folder!</p>
					</li>
					<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
					<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png" />
