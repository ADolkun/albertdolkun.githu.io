            <i>Data Science Major | 4th Year</i>
            <p>I'm a transfer student from SoCal, Orange County, and this is my second year doing coding related stuff. I did a
                cross country roadtrip last summer, and I enjoy snowboarding, cooking, and taking photos. Recently, I've back to
                the
                gym so that I can eat MORE! Would love to make more friends from the class, so feel free to hit me up on
                Instagram
                @AlbertDolkun or just talk to me in person (I'm pretty friendly)! <b>Wanna try riding my OneWheel?!</b>
            </p>

                <li>We should be more aware of the app/website's design when we're using it. Such as the hierarchy, content,
                    intent, and audience.</li>
                <li>The GIF examples that are used to explain the content.</li>
