                <p>Built a tower defense game by using an OOP paradigm that is inspired by Plants Vs. Zombies with a similar

                    character in the game and kept track of game stats like time elapsed, character position, and usable
                    resources.

                <p>Developed an interpreter that takes in Scheme expressions and outputs the values.
                    <br>Handles call expressions, primitive expressions, and special forms like define, lambda, let, etc. in
                    total of three steps.
                    <br>Reads the expression as a python data structure, and evaluates the expression by parsing, then
                    prints out the final value.

                <p>Implemented a java program by writing tests, exceptions and implementing functions that simulates a WWII

                    <br>Implemented a multilayer mismatching mechanism that encrypts or decrypts by going through various
                    rotors permutating the given message.

                    into local/online files.
                    <br>Used different data structures such as BFS and TreeMap to make sure the running efficiency of the
                    program, especially the <i>merge</i> function as it may go through all the ancestors and possibly read
                    the content of each file in the history.
